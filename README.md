#Milestone 1
Forked and cloned the repo successfully, I was able to login in to MongoDb adn created a cluster together with a databse so that deploying the app can be easier.
I also changed the username and password from my terminal.

#Milestone 2
Here I was able to create a pipeline on jenkins, adn also install the npm install feature. I pushed the project and it could show darkroom
 on render.
